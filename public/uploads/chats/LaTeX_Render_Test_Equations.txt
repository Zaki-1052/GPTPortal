User: <user_message> hi there! im trying to test the latex rendering on my UI, so id like it if you could give me a latex equation in a code block, then in each display style of latex so i can see if they all render properly. thanks </user_message>

Assistant: I'll help you test LaTeX rendering with the same equation shown in different display styles. I'll use the quadratic formula as an example.

First, here's the equation in a code block:
```latex
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
```

Now, here it is in different LaTeX display styles:

Inline mode ($....$):
$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

Display mode ($$....$$):
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Using \[....\]:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]

Using equation environment:
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

These different display styles should render differently in your UI if LaTeX support is working correctly. The inline mode should flow with the text, while the display modes should center the equation on its own line. Let me know if you'd like to test any other LaTeX features or if you need help troubleshooting the rendering.

Conversation Summary: The user asked for a LaTeX equation in various formats to test how their UI renders LaTeX. The assistant provided the quadratic formula in a code block and in several LaTeX display styles: inline mode, display mode with double dollar signs, bracketed display mode, and the equation environment. The assistant explained how each should appear if rendering works correctly and offered further help if needed.
