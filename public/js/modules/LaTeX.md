# GPTPortal LaTeX Implementation - Current Status

## Status: NOT WORKING

**Current State**: LaTeX rendering is broken in GPTPortal

## Summary

The LaTeX rendering functionality in GPTPortal is currently non-functional. Multiple approaches have been attempted but none successfully render LaTeX expressions properly.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation attempts to use `marked-katex-extension` as a marked.js extension to handle LaTeX during markdown parsing. However, this approach has several critical issues.

### Files Involved
- `/public/portal.html` - Loads KaTeX CSS/JS and marked-katex-extension
- `/public/js/modules/messageHandler.js` - Main message rendering logic
- `/public/js/modules/chatManager.js` - Chat management (defers to messageHandler)

### Libraries Loaded
- marked.js v4.x - Markdown parser
- KaTeX 0.16.9 - LaTeX rendering engine
- marked-katex-extension v5.1.4 - Marked extension for KaTeX
- DOMPurify - HTML sanitizer

## The Problems

### 1. Block LaTeX Not Working
Console tests show that block-level LaTeX (using `$$...$$` or `\[...\]`) does NOT work:
```
Block LaTeX: ✗ Not working
Block with $$: ✗ Not working  
Block with \[: ✗ Not working
```

### 2. `breaks: true` Incompatibility
The marked.js option `breaks: true` (which converts newlines to `<br>` tags) is incompatible with block LaTeX. It processes the text BEFORE the KaTeX extension can handle it, resulting in:
```
Input: Block:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Output: <p>Block:<br>$$<br>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}<br>$$</p>
```

### 3. Inline LaTeX Issues
Even inline LaTeX has problems:
- `\(...\)` syntax doesn't work at all
- `$...$` syntax only partially works
- LaTeX expressions get broken up with individual characters on separate lines

### 4. Configuration Order Confusion
Multiple attempts to fix the configuration order (extension before/after setOptions) have not resolved the issues.

## What Has Been Tried

### Attempt 1: Configuration Order Fix
**Theory**: marked.setOptions() was being called before marked.use(markedKatex())  
**Result**: No improvement - block LaTeX still broken

### Attempt 2: Disable `breaks: true`
**Theory**: The `breaks: true` option was interfering with block LaTeX  
**Result**: Inline LaTeX works (but not really) in tests but block LaTeX still fails

### Attempt 3: Create Isolated Marked Instance
**Theory**: Global marked instance might have conflicts  
**Result**: No improvement

### Attempt 4: DOMPurify Configuration
**Theory**: DOMPurify might be stripping KaTeX output  
**Result**: Tests show KaTeX HTML survives sanitization but still doesn't render properl

**Note**: The current code has been cleaned up to remove the broken LaTeX implementation. Basic markdown functionality has been preserved.
